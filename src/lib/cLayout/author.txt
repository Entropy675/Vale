Clay (short for C Layout) is a high performance 2D UI layout library.
Major Features

    Microsecond layout performance
    Flex-box like layout model for complex, responsive layouts including text wrapping, scrolling containers and aspect ratio scaling
    Single ~2k LOC clay.h file with zero dependencies (including no standard library)
    Wasm support: compile with clang to a 15kb uncompressed .wasm file for use in the browser
    Static arena based memory use with no malloc / free, and low total memory overhead (e.g. ~3.5mb for 8192 layout elements).
    React-like nested declarative syntax
    Renderer agnostic: outputs a sorted list of rendering primitives that can be easily composited in any 3D engine, and even compiled to HTML (examples provided)


In Vale, this library is used for all GUI draw operations. Working on a renderer for openframeworks atm.
