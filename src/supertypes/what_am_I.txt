What is a supertype?
A supertype is a class attributed to a tag.
Tags normally only have an associated tag-wide context object. But each supertype has this object and also determines the class of the entity instance itself.
The first supertype tag on an entity determines its class, if there are more then the others are treated as regular tags.

PhysicsEntity/Entity are virtual, so an entity MUST have a supertype class.
That means that the class heirarchy and the order of tags in an entity are always the following:
Class: Entity <- PhysicsEntity <- Determining Supertype
tags = ["entity", "physics", "Hero"]

Class: Entity <- Determining Supertype
tags = ["entity", "Hero"]

This allows us to statically determine types in runtime, and allows entities to be composed of classes.
This system may be subject to further change and refinement going forward.
