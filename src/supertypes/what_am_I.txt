What is a supertype?
A supertype is a class attributed to a tag.
Tags normally only have an associated tag-wide context object. But each supertype has this object and also determines the class of the entity instance itself.
The first supertype tag on an entity determines its class, if there are more then the others are treated as regular tags (no supertpe class, context object etc still aplies).
This allows us to statically determine types in runtime, and allows entities to be composed of classes.
This system may be subject to further change and refinement going forward.
